Show us what you can do
=======================

[resumes-json.txt](https://raw.github.com/indeedeng/resume-sample-data/master/resumes-json.txt) contains some resume data. To jump your application to work at Indeed to the front of the line for consideration, build something interesting with this data.

You might want to build an interesting browser-based visualization, or you might just put together a simple web-based resume review tool. The only limit is your imagination. We're not looking for polish or design skill here -- just show us that you can produce working code that does something interesting. Think of it as a mini-hackathon. Bonus points if you use both browser (i.e. JavaScript) and server (e.g. Node.js, Java, C#, PHP, etc.) components. Feel free to use any tools or technologies that you like, and share the code with using whatever mechanism you prefer.
